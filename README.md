## This is a single page web application which is made using Javascript and Tailwind CSS. It's made using Next Js 13 with eslint configuration.

-- This application focuses more on the styling and animations which are used using framer motions. I have created this to showcase my development and frontend skills, also keeping into consideration the folder structure of the project as folder structure is also very important when working with big enterprise applications.
